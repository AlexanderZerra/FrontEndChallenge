# **Movie App**

## **Welcome**
**The Movie app that you are viewing today was created in response to an assignment given out by the Outcomes Team from GA. The assignment was a front end challenge to create a working front end app with an API. I created the movie APP. Its extremely basic in design but it hits all the major points. It uses React as the front end library. Youll notice some familiar key terms like: Redux, Browser Router, Thunk and more. Overall the challenge was...hairy. It really showed me that my React knowledge really needs a big push. Setting up that API call with TMDB was...well the easiest way to say it a nightmare. Haha. Please enjoy the movie App.**
